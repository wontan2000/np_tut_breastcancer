# Numpy and matplotlib tutorial for beginners using a breastcancer dataset.

## Running this tutorial online:
You can Launch this tutorial on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wontan2000/np_tut_breastcancer/master) or [![Google Colab](https://badgen.net/badge/Launch/on%20Google%20Colab/blue?icon=terminal)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/subhacom/np_tut_breastcancer/blob/master/Wisconsin_breast_cancer_data.ipynb).
The slide-show will work on `binder`, but not `colab`. Press `Alt+r` to toggle slide-show.

## Running this tutorial on your own computer:
You need to have Python installed with numpy, matplotlib and pandas libraries. [https://www.anaconda.com/](Anaconda) Python distribution is easy to install and bundles common libraries for scientific computing.
1. Click the `Clone or download` button. 
1. Select `Download ZIP`.
1. Unzip the downloaded zip file into a folder.
1. Open a terminal (command prompt/anaconda prompt on Windows) and go to this folder by entering `cd folder-path` command).
1. Start jupyter notebook (enter `jupyter notebook`). This will open a browser window showing the contents of the folder.
1. Click the `Wisconsin_breast_cancer_data.ipynb` file and this will open the notebook in a new window or tab of the browser.
1. In order to run it as slide-show you must install [https://rise.readthedocs.io](RISE) module first. Press `Alt+r` to toggle slide-show.

## History:
It was originally the first part of a two part workshop on the basics of `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `pandas` for data science. The first version used in the live workshop can be downloaded as an archive here: https://github.com/subhacom/np_tut_breastcancer/releases/tag/v0.1. This notebook may be updated occasionally. 

The second part of the workshop focuses on `pandas` for data science and is available here: https://github.com/bballew/pandas_tutorial.
